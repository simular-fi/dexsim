# DEXsim

An API to create and interact with a local version of Uniswap v3.  This library
use a pre-deployed version of Uniswap v3 along with a set of pre-deployed pools. It's intended for use in agent-based modeling or other simulation environments. It's also a useful tool in learning about how Uniswap works.

Under the covers, `dexsim` is built on [Simular](https://simular.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) that uses a production-grade EVM. Uniswap v3 is deployed from a snapshot from the main Ethereun chain. However, it does not include any state other than currently supported pools.

The pools are only deployed, not initialized with an starting price. You can set the starting price via the configuration file described below. 

## Install
```console
> pip install dexsim
```

## Getting started

The following pools can be configured and used:
| pool          | fee        | pool name     |
| ------------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| **usdc/dai**  | 100 (0.01) | usdc_dai_100  |
| **usdc/dai**  | 500 (0.05) | usdc_dai_500  |
| **usdc/weth** | 500 (0.05) | usdc_weth_500 |
| **dai/weth**  | 500 (0.05) | dai_weth_500  |
| **wbtc/weth** | 500 (0.05) | wbtc_weth_500 |
| **wbtc/dai**  | 500 (0.05) | wbtc_dai_500  |
| **wbtc/usdc** | 500 (0.05) | wbtc_usdc_500 |

The pools must be initialized with a starting price via the YAML configuration file. You only need to configure the pools you intend to use.  Here's an example of the file format:

Example config file: `example.yaml`
```yaml
simulator:
  pools:
    usdc_dai_100: [1, 1]
    usdc_weth_500: [5000, 1]
```
This configures 2 pools with there exchange prices: 
* `usdc_dai_100` = 1 usdc for 1 dai
* `usdc_weth_500` = 5000 usdc for 1 weth.

Here's an example of creating and using the pools:

```python
from dexsim import DEX

# Create the Unswap DEX based on the configuration file
dex = DEX('./example.yaml')
assert 2 == dex.total_number_of_pools()
assert (5000, 0.0002) == dex.pools.usdc_weth_500.exchange_rates()

# create a wallet for Bob
bob = dex.create_wallet()

# mint some ERC20 tokens for bob
dex.pools.usdc_weth_500.mint_tokens(10000, 2, bob)

# mint a liquidity position for bob in the price range of $4900 - $5100 by 
# providing 10_000 usdc and 2 weth.  
# Note the prices are specified in terms of the y token (weth)
_, _, _, nft_id = dex.pools.usdc_weth_500.mint_liquidity_position(
        10000, 2, 1 / 4900, 1 / 5100, bob
    )
```

## Lending
 Each pool can also provide a lending pool for models.  Lending pools can be configured 
 along side the uniswap pools.  For example:

 ```yaml
simulator:
  pools:
    usdc_dai_100: [1, 1]
    usdc_weth_500: [5000, 1]
  lending:
    usdc_weth_500: weth
```

adds a lending pool for the USDC/WETH pair. It specifies the `weth` is the collateral token.  The format 
for configuring lending pools is: `uniswap pool name : name of collateral token`.

When the `dex` is started it will automtically configure and create the uniswap and lending pools. Working with 
the lending API is very similar to working with pools....

Example using the configuration above where the lending is available for the `usdc_weth_500` pool and
the collateral token is `weth`

```python
from dexsim import DEX

# borrow USDC with WETH collateral 
# note: under the covers, the values are converted to 1e18 decimals
BORROW_AMOUNT = 10_000
WETH_REQUIRED = 2.5

dex = DEX('...configuration file...')
agent = dex.create_wallet()

assert 0 == dex.lending.usdc_weth_500.collateral_token_balance(agent)

# calculate how much WETH is required to borrow USDC
weth_needed = dex.lending.usdc_weth_500.collateral_required(BORROW_AMOUNT)
assert WETH_REQUIRED == weth_needed

# mint weth for the user (this is for convenience) mint erc20 collateral token
dex.lending.usdc_weth_500.mint_collateral_token(weth_needed, agent)
assert WETH_REQUIRED == dex.lending.usdc_weth_500.collateral_token_balance(agent)

# supply the weth collateral for the loan
dex.lending.usdc_weth_500.provide_collateral(weth_needed, agent)

# take loan
dex.lending.usdc_weth_500.borrow(BORROW_AMOUNT, agent)

# check loan information (value are in 1e18 format)
assert [
    2500000000000000000,
    10000000000000000000000,
    True,
] == dex.lending.usdc_weth_500.loan_information(agent)

# check we got the loan
assert 10_000 == dex.lending.usdc_weth_500.lending_token_balance(agent)
```
